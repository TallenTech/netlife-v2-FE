# WhatsApp Authentication Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the mock WhatsApp authentication implementation in the NetLife frontend with real backend API integration. The integration will connect the existing WhatsAppAuth component with the deployed Supabase edge functions to provide actual WhatsApp OTP authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real OTP Code Sending

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive actual WhatsApp OTP codes when I enter my phone number, so that I can authenticate securely with my real WhatsApp account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid phone number THEN the system SHALL send a real WhatsApp OTP code using the backend API
2. WHEN the OTP sending is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and move to verification step
3. WHEN the OTP sending fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages based on the API response
4. WHEN a user requests too many codes THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully with proper user feedback

### Requirement 2: Real OTP Code Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want to verify the actual OTP code I received via WhatsApp, so that I can complete the authentication process securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters the correct OTP code THEN the system SHALL verify it against the backend API
2. WHEN verification is successful THEN the system SHALL receive user data and proceed to the next step
3. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the OTP code expires THEN the system SHALL inform the user and allow code resending

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear and helpful error messages when authentication fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and retry options
3. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL show countdown timers and clear explanations
4. WHEN phone number format is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide format guidance

### Requirement 4: Phone Number Format Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to properly handle my phone number format, so that the API calls work correctly regardless of how I enter my number.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a phone number with spaces or formatting THEN the system SHALL clean it for API calls
2. WHEN the phone number is in the correct format THEN it SHALL be sent to the API without modification
3. WHEN the phone number format is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear format requirements
4. WHEN the API expects international format THEN the system SHALL ensure proper formatting

### Requirement 5: Loading State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear loading indicators during authentication steps, so that I know the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN sending OTP codes THEN the system SHALL disable the send button and show loading state
3. WHEN verifying codes THEN the system SHALL disable the verify button and show loading state
4. WHEN API calls complete THEN the system SHALL remove loading indicators and enable appropriate actions
