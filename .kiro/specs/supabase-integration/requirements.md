# Supabase Client Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating the Supabase client library into the NetLife frontend application to connect with the existing WhatsApp authentication backend. The integration will replace the current localStorage-based authentication system with a proper backend-connected authentication flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Supabase Client Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up the Supabase client in the NetLife frontend, so that the application can communicate with the deployed backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Supabase client library is installed THEN it SHALL be available as a project dependency
2. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the application SHALL have access to Supabase URL and anon key
3. WHEN the Supabase client is initialized THEN it SHALL be configured with the correct project credentials
4. WHEN the client configuration is complete THEN it SHALL be exportable for use across the application

### Requirement 2: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure environment variables for the Supabase connection, so that the application can connect to the correct backend environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are created THEN they SHALL include VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
2. WHEN the environment file is configured THEN it SHALL use the production Supabase URL from the API documentation
3. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN they SHALL be properly prefixed with VITE_ for Vite compatibility
4. WHEN the configuration is complete THEN sensitive keys SHALL be properly secured and not committed to version control

### Requirement 3: Client Library Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a centralized Supabase client instance, so that all components can use the same configured client for API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Supabase client file is created THEN it SHALL export a configured client instance
2. WHEN the client is initialized THEN it SHALL use the environment variables for configuration
3. WHEN the client is configured THEN it SHALL include proper authentication settings
4. WHEN the client is ready THEN it SHALL be importable from other components and contexts

### Requirement 4: Authentication Context Preparation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prepare the authentication context for Supabase integration, so that the existing authentication flow can be updated to use the backend API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current AuthContext is reviewed THEN the localStorage-based authentication SHALL be identified for replacement
2. WHEN the integration points are identified THEN they SHALL align with the WhatsApp authentication API endpoints
3. WHEN the context structure is analyzed THEN it SHALL be compatible with the new authentication flow
4. WHEN the preparation is complete THEN the next integration steps SHALL be clearly defined
