# Video Analytics Counting Fix

## Problem
The video analytics system was not properly counting likes and views. The system was:
1. Recording individual interactions in `video_views`, `video_likes`, and `video_shares` tables
2. But reading static `view_count`, `like_count`, and `share_count` fields from the `videos` table
3. These static fields were never being updated, so counts remained at 0

## Solution
Updated the video analytics system to:

### 1. **Dynamic Count Calculation**
- Modified `getVideoAnalytics()` to calculate counts dynamically from related tables
- Uses `COUNT()` queries on `video_views`, `video_likes`, and `video_shares` tables
- Ensures counts are always accurate and up-to-date

### 2. **Automatic Count Updates**
- Added automatic count updates when actions occur:
  - `trackVideoView()` now calls `updateVideoViewCount()`
  - `toggleVideoLike()` now calls `updateVideoLikeCount()`
  - `trackVideoShare()` now calls `updateVideoShareCount()`

### 3. **Helper Functions**
- `getVideoViewCount(videoId)` - Gets count from `video_views` table
- `getVideoLikeCount(videoId)` - Gets count from `video_likes` table
- `getVideoShareCount(videoId)` - Gets count from `video_shares` table
- `updateVideoViewCount(videoId)` - Updates `videos.view_count`
- `updateVideoLikeCount(videoId)` - Updates `videos.like_count`
- `updateVideoShareCount(videoId)` - Updates `videos.share_count`

### 4. **Data Sync Utility**
- Added `syncAllVideoCounts()` function to fix existing data
- Available as `window.syncVideoCounts()` in browser console
- Updates all video counts to match actual records

## Files Modified
- `src/services/videoAnalyticsService.js` - Main service with counting logic and immediate view tracking
- `src/hooks/useVideoAnalytics.js` - Fixed missing queryClient imports and added view start tracking
- `src/pages/VideoPlayer.jsx` - Updated to track views immediately when user starts playing
- `src/utils/syncVideoCounts.js` - Utility for syncing existing data
- `src/main.jsx` - Imports sync utility for browser console access
- `src/services/__tests__/videoAnalyticsService.test.js` - Tests for the service

## How to Fix Existing Data
If you have existing video interactions that aren't being counted:

1. **Open browser console** on your app
2. **Run the sync command**: `syncVideoCounts()`
3. **Wait for completion** - it will update all video counts

## View Tracking Behavior

- **Immediate tracking**: Views are counted as soon as the user starts playing the video
- **Complete tracking**: When the video ends, it's marked as a complete view
- **Partial views**: Even if the user doesn't finish the video, the view is still counted

## Testing
The fix includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Dynamic count calculation
- Like/unlike functionality
- View tracking
- User like status checking

## Benefits
- ✅ **Accurate counts** - Always reflects actual interactions
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - Counts update immediately after actions
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - Works with existing data
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - Uses efficient COUNT queries
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks if updates fail
